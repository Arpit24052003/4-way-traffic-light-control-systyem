# 4-way-traffic-light-control-system
This is my first project using arduino uno.This project uses the Arduino UNO to synchronize and manage a four-way traffic signal, giving a complete solution for traffic crossings. MArobotics’ implementation focuses on improving road safety and traffic flow by precisely timing and sequencing traffic lights. The system’s adaptability enables easy integration into urban infrastructure, making it an invaluable tool for controlling junctions and encouraging a smoother and safer traffic experience. This project provides a realistic knowledge of how traffic lights work and can be controlled using programmable electronics by utilizing an Arduino Uno and specialized traffic light modules.
